Our code is built upon [diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) and [task vectors](https://github.com/mlfoundations/task_vectors). We also refer to the [model soups](https://github.com/mlfoundations/model-soups) and [dnn mode connectivity](https://github.com/timgaripov/dnn-mode-connectivity). Thanks to the contributors for their great work!
